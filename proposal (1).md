# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Machine learning in python for EEG data

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

EEG classifier that is able to distinguish between normal and abnormal brainwaves.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will spot abnormal and normal activities. Patient record is proceed assuming normal activit, however considered abnormal when pathological morphology appears. There has been previous work on this by student from Northwestern University. I am trying to beat her accuracy and false rates and build a model that gives more accurate outcome.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I am combining it with my research job in Neural Engineering Data Consortium (NEDC) where I am annotating ambulatory EEG data. It is a good way to learn more about data processing.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

No.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will have a outcome, regardless of the accuracy.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The researcher who already worked on this problem had 72% of accuracy. My goal is to have 80% of accuracy.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I will have 85% of accuracy and I will find out something new- something that the previous researcher did not notice.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I have to dive deeper into understanding how ML models are working with EEG data. I have to develop my model and undertand how EEG data reacts to this. I think it will be very challenging project but helpful for my research.
