#### Project title

Normal/abnormal seizure classifier using machine learning


#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have done many readings and looked into code and data previous researcher working on the normal/abnormal classifier did. I also had a meeting with my lab professor who originally wrote the code and he gave me some advice how to make the classifier more accurate. I asked if we could feed it more information but it already uses the full depth of our database. Mostly my work right now has been doing research on the topic to understand how the classifier is interpreting the data.

Articles I have worked with:

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Made any changes in the classifier, neither I haven't run the classifier on the data yet. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Right now I have trouble running the classifier because the data is located in our own cluster therefore, I won't be able to run it on the data using visual studio code, I think I have to rsync the data before. It seems to be much bigger project than my knowledge right now and hence I have to do a lot of reading. I am not sure if I am able to beat previous researcher's false rate numbers like originally intended.
